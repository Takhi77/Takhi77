These projects are running on the node-backend for utilizing the token trading like pumpfun and raydium
That's my main skill to work with token trading field
I even also ***duplicated the pumpfun's working method as new replica contract***

*ðŸŒ±Pumpfun sniperðŸŒ±: Track new pools from pump.fun and snipes token from it after filtering
*ðŸŒ±Raydium sniping botðŸŒ± : Track new pools and buy from it using several transaction services
*ðŸŒ±Volume botðŸŒ±: Control market caps with various strategy so the volume stays or increase to specific MC or liquidity
*ðŸŒ±Shit-token LauncherðŸŒ±: Deploy new pools on raydium and make profits from quick sniping bots
*ðŸŒ±Token-freezerðŸŒ±: Create pool with token and freezes any token account it needs, providing good chance for strategies "honeypot"
*ðŸŒ±Holder botðŸŒ±: Increase the holder of the token by distributing the token in Dev wallet
*ðŸŒ±Maker botðŸŒ±: Increase the token trader by making the wallets buy and sell the token from the pool
I am trying to make ðŸŒ±Arbitrage botðŸŒ± nowadays

I also worked with ***smart contract*** and ***web3 projects*** like p2e games
**Pump.fun forking SC**, **Presale SC**, **DCA SC**, **SOL locker SC**, **Pnft staking SC** and so on...
If you need help from Solana projects, please look for me since I am specialized in these kind of projects.
