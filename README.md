I have been breaking things professionally since early 2017. My whole career has been focused on offensive security with a strong background doing pen-testing of "traditional" stuff like web, mobile, or cloud, but since 2021, I have been working full-time as a Smart Contract auditor.
In addition, I **lecture** on **Solana security** to ðŸŒ±blockchain studentsðŸŒ± through the discord social and give workshops/talks on the topic occasionally.
