## Hi there! 👋 
============================
* Blockchain (Cosmwasm, Solana) Engineer
* Full Stack Developer
* Technical Advisor
* Project Manager

* Drop a line to **[@jcr_auditor](https://t.me/skeleton)** in Telegram or email me at **ewantomson1103@gmail.com**

I have been breaking things professionally since early 2016. My whole career has been focused on offensive security with a strong background doing pen-testing of "traditional" stuff like web, mobile, or cloud, but since 2021, I have been working full-time as a Smart Contract auditor.

In addition, I **lecture** on **Solana security** to 🌱blockchain students🌱 through the discord social and give workshops/talks on the topic occasionally.
